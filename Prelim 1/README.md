P 1 was written in a pdf file combined with fitting figure and excel file.
P 2 have the attached files and code for each problem question.
2c) all figures are plotted in the file problem 2c.
2d) figures for s=0.02, s=10 and s=10000 are plotted in file problem 2d
with middle s value to 100, the oscillation exists. When above saddle, the oscillation will disappear.
2e) the increased s value is incoherent when s reach 100. When s above the saddle node, the oscillation are coherent.
2f)Based on the figure S100 and S105. The figures S105 to S100 will also have the coherent oscillation.
